Heres a list of mods that after ~5k hours of playing, I think would give the best experience for when you play with Zoil. Feel free to use it or not, these are just recommendations.

    Calamity Mod
    Calamity Infernum
    Calamity Vanities
    Terraria Overhaul
    Fargo's Mutant Mod
    Boss Checklist
    Recipe Browser
    Lights and Shadows
    Magic Storage
    Basic Automated Mining
    MEAC (Optional, look it up on youtube)

I also highly recommend getting the calamity texture pack and UI pack here https://github.com/Altalyra/CalamityTexturePack/releases
